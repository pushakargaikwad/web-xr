A modern WebXR application built with React, enabling immersive Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences directly in your web browser. This project demonstrates the capabilities of WebXR API using React components.

## Features

- üéÆ VR/AR Mode Support
- üñ±Ô∏è Interactive 3D Objects
- üéØ Pointer Events
- üîÑ Transform Controls
- üì± Cross-device Compatible

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)
- A WebXR-compatible browser and device

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pushakargaikwad/web-xr.git
   cd web-xr
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host
```

Use the following command to serve the app using the basicSsl plugin, allowing you to access it at https://your-ip-address:5173.

You may encounter a warning about an invalid certificate when accessing the site from your browser; you can safely ignore it to proceed.

```bash
npx vite serve --host
```

The `--host` flag makes the server accessible from other devices on your network, which is useful for testing on VR/AR devices.
